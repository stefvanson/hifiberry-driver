Hifiberry DAC+ library
======================
Project for creating a library for using the Hifiberry DAC+ in Raspberry Pi
(3B+) bare metal projects.

Note that it currently is just a start with which sound can be generated. It
needs quite some work and documentation and testing is not complete.

Structure
---------
All driver code is located in src/driver.
Some code for testing the library on the target is located in src/test.

Prerequisites
-------------
Doxygen must be installed if you want to generate documentation.
